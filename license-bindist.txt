MKMK by Luis Crespo
*******************

"MKMK" the Make a Makefile Utility

Hamburg (Germany), the 2nd December 1997.
HTML by Nils Pipenbrinck aka Submissive/Cubic & $eeN
Utility by Luis Crespo

Introduction

MKMK is a small and silly utility I made for my own convinience. Manually creating a MAKEFILE for each project
is a boring task, and it is also dangerous: when the project is big enough, the dependencies are really complicated.
For example a C++ file could include 8 files, each of which could include some others, and so on. If you omit a 
dependency, you can change a header file and not recompile all the necessary object files. Then, if you change a 
structure definition in that header and recompile, your program would probably crash or behave strange. 
MKMK creates the MAKEFILE for you. It parses your source files and creates a dependency list for each of them, 
by searching the "#include" strings in your files.

Usage

MKMK exe-name source-list
Exe-name is the name of your executable file. You must specify the extension too. Source-list is the list of your 
C/C++ source files. You can use wildcards, and you can list several file names. Before blindly running WMAKE, it 
is better to take a look at the MAKEFILE generated by MKMK. You will see that there is an empty variable, "LIBS". 
You can put there the libraries your project needs, or else you MUST edit the last line of the MAKEFILE and delete 
the "library {$(LIBS)}" part. If you don't do so, you will get an error message from WMAKE.

Examples

MKMK myprog.exe *.cpp
This is the most common use of MKMK: you just have to put all the source files in a directory and type something like 
the command above. MKMK will create a MAKEFILE that will compile and link all the source files in your directory to 
create "myprog.exe".

MKMK myprog.exe game*.cpp sound\*.c This command will scan all files matching game*.cpp and sound\*.c and create a 
dependency entry for each of them in the MAKEFILE.

Disclaimer

Well that is what MKMK does. Of course, there is a lot of things that MKMK does not do. For example it does not 
support assembler sources, so you will have to add their dependencies manually. Also the program could be more 
configurable, having some definitions in a separage CFG file, and it could generate an output file with a name 
other than MAKEFILE, specified by the user.
If you use the program and find that it would be useful that MKMK would do something, just code it. That is why I 
give out the source code. If you add features to the program, please tell me, I would like to know it, and that way 
I can put together the different enhancements and post them on the web, presumably on the same page you found it. 
It would be better if the enhancement is given in a separate source file, for the sake of modularity.
Of course, if you find some bug, please tell me, but don't confuse a bug with a missing feature. For example, 
the C/C++ include file parser is a very simple one and can easily be cheated. I haven't tried to, but maybe comments 
inside strings can make the parser take wrong decisions. One obvious improvement would be to use a LEX generated 
parser instead of the "manual" one I have coded. Another missing feature is that MKMK is unable to trace dependencies 
inside include files that are located in a different directory that the one that included it.

Source Code

MKMK has been sucessfully compiled with BC++ 3.1 and Watcom C++ 10.5. The executable version is the one compiled with 
BC++ 3.1, and is the only one that has been tested. Well, in fact it's the one I use and that usage is almost the 
only testing that I have done. Feel free to upgrade the utility to whatever you think useful. If you send it to me, 
I will post your upgrade in the web and give you the proper credit.

ReportWriter for wxWidgets

Hi wxWidgets users!

This page is a 'quick and dirty' effort to release our report writer to the community since every now and then 
people are asking for such a tool. So, please don't flame me because the page isn't looking as good as you would 
like it ;-)

On this page you can find the sources for our report writer tool for wxWidgets. With it, it's easy to create table 
based reports for all kinds of data. The report writer stores all created reports in a configurable directory for 
later previewing and/or printing. Each report can be annotated with information about when and by whom it was 
created (see dialog below). All reports are saved in a compact binary format.

Within a report you can start a sub-report at any time; and within a sub-report you can have another sub-report... 
This hierarchy is unlimited.

Page breaks are handled automatically, but the user can insert additional page breaks where he/she needs them. 
Report writer was created to have absolute control over the positioning (and increments) of the objects used on a 
page. All position information is in Millimeters with a resolution of 0.01mm

One can preview or print ramdomly selected pages. For this you can navigate to selected pages in the preview dialog 
very easily. ReportWriter is optimized for speed to find the selected page very quickly even in a 1000+ pages report.

Since I'm very busy these days I've not been able to write documentation for this piece of software. If you're able 
to understand the code of the demo application, please feel free to use the ReportWriter for your projects. Otherwise 
you should still wait for documentation.
