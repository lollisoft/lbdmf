		This file describes some things that should be done in the next time.
		
		I also will discuss some problems while the development stages.

		22.09.2008	There are some remaining problems with sqlite based databases when opening
				the 4th detailform over a master detail action. The problem is that there
				are unexplainable database lock I was not yet capable of fixing by holding
				the database statements as short as possible open.

				The problem currently only occurs on Windows, but not on Mac. Other platforms
				are not tested yet.

				To avoid this behaviour, the form that could not be filled with data, should
				be filled with a dummy entry if only that form is open. 

		07.07.2008	Instance messaging tested with tcpdump tracing on port 5222 and 5223. There
				was some communication, but it didn't came to me.
				Try to record the raw communication. Another test.

				There was a logfile I have overseen :-)
				Also there was an authentication error. Retry.

				At all it was the authentication problem. Again got a message.

		01.06.2008	Improve Cruise Control integration.
				
				Instant messaging works from now on.

		16.04.2008	Creating Sqlite Database script in usual way fails due to unsupported ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT.
				Solution could be parsing these statements and separate the step of creating foreign keys to an
				internal subsequent statement. While parsing them the statements could be rewritten to be triggers.
				Additional metadata could be created to enable logical extraction of foreign key information.

		14.04.2008	Importing XMI 2.1 formatted files are working, but complete application logic transfer
				to a new database does not work. There are missing three steps:

				1. In the table column_types is missing ro boolean column.
 				2. No user account has been created.
				3. Type of dynamic database formular must be created in table formulartypen.

				ODBC library path settings should be taken from odbc_config.

				Shell scripts for setting um environment under Mac OS X does still not work.

		01.04.2008	Testing package on a newly installed Mac OS X.
				
				There are any things that are not working without manual steps:
				
				Must call environment-osx.sh to get OSTYPE and some other environment
				variables.

				Download unixODBC and do the following steps:

					./configure --enable-gui=no     (If no Qt libraries are installed)
					make
					make install

				The configure script does set the prefix to /usr/local, so I may change my
				prefix for the required libodbc.dylib file.

				CVS source code version needs to get wxWidgets from anywhere.
				On Mac it is still the wxMac 2.6.2 version.

				Build the wxWidgets library with the following options:

					./configure --enable-monolithic=yes --enable-shared=yes
					make
					make install

				After installing the library, you need to remove the created dylib files in
				output directory of the wxWidgets library. Do not make clean.

				Add /usr/local/bin to the path variable to enable access to wx-config, if
				the prefix has not been changed.

				The environment-osx.sh script does not really work. Do a cat and copy paste
				the commands.

				The documentation for the Mac OS X system must be written in the API doc.

				The Sqlite library didn't get cleaned and installed nor build. It is propably
				not in the target list.

				Sample.r in vendor/wxaui-0.9.1/sample is missing.

		03.12.2005	DatabaseForms lack to handle proper adding of data in an empty table.
				The form does not update the entered data after 'Add' has been pressed.
				There must be added a second row. Then manipulating rows will work.

		18.10.2005	DatabaseReport is missing a function to get the value of a replacement.
				The replacement for example is a customer number that will be shown in
				the form, that calls the database report. In the case of custom where
				clauses, the column of the where clause may contain a foreign key and it
				should be shown the representative value of it.
				
				It this case the customer number should be shown. If the database report
				has been called from inside a database form, the form could pass it self
				to the database report as a parent. Given this, the form could ask the
				database form for the correct value, since it has it.
				
				But there will be another case of calling a database report. The application
				could be configured to have a menu entry. In this case there is no form as a
				base.
				
				The best enhancement then would be the extraction of that code, who is
				responsible for getting the values inside the foreign key drop down boxes.
				
				This also could be used inside the database report.

		30.09.2005	Database type int8 from postgreSQL is currently not supported.

			01.10.2005: Added the support. Also detect redadonly columns such
				as aggregated columns (count, avg, ...)

		24.09.2005	If the binary samples downloaded and no database configuration
				has been set up (ODBC setup), the application crashes with a
				NULL pointer exeption.
				
			24.09.2005: 
					Need to create an assistant for ODBC setup,
					need to extend the database classes to support
					with ODBC setup API.
					
			24.09.2005:
					Fallback to a file based configuration. This is in
					work, but no decision has been made.
					
					A first step would be streaming, then syncing with
					the database.

			24.09.2005:
					There may be a bug in the current ODBC driver. Uninstalling
					it and reinstalling the 7.03.0200 driver fails, because the
					old driver isn't uninstalled properly.
					
					This may have to do with the database installer's optional
					ODBC driver installing step. 

		28.08.2005	There is a design problem or a visual problem with foreign key
				values, when they should show names that could appear multiple
				times. In this case it is unclear what the user should select.

				As a sample, the formular_parameters form points to it's formular
				table, in which case the additional information about the application
				is missing.

				There were two solutions for that:

				Show the application at the second name in the drop down list.

				Let the list depent it's values on another dropdown's selected value.
				In that case the selected application. If the application for the current
				entry has been changed, the form value becomes invalid, because the containing
				list of forms has been chaned too.

		26.08.2005	There is a problem with queries, that don't result in data.
				The form then has no result set and probably could not add
				new data.
				
			28.08.2005: Adding works, but the app crashes after adding
				by navigating to any other data. This must be tested a little
				more.

		14.08.2005	Mac OS X:
		
				Debug Malloc functionality should be integrated, if there is anything
				to integrate.
				http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/MallocOptions.html

				There still is a problem with check boxes.
				
				Database scripts:
				
				There is still a bad thing with database model scripts for different
				database systems. Isn't there a solution for it in one file of any
				format ?
		
		09.08.2005	Master -> detail and detail -> master dialogs have been implemented.
				
				Missing functionality are direct update events, if an user select a
				different row in the master dialog (customers for example). The update
				could be fired by pressing the action button after the data has been
				displayed.
		
		27.04.2005	There is a problem in the new configuration dialog, that let the user select
				the correct column to show for a foreign key.
				
				If the table is only, say, a connection table for other entries, the real data
				to be shown would be in the master table of the referred entry.
				
				Slave table
				    Master table to be referrenced by entries of slave table.
				A-> location A
				|
				B-> location B
				|
				C-> location C
				
		19.04.2005	There was a problem with readonly columns and the bound column for it.
				
			19.04.2004 Solution was to shortly unbind the column. -> API enhancement.

		01.02.2005	Problems to port the framework to Mac OS X 10 and hints for solutions found.

			?	Any solution has been found.
		
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Try to compile code under Mac OS X 10 makes some problems. Try with lbHook

		29.01.2005	Database problems and other things
				Found some unimplemented features in the MYSQL database
				engine, or the workaround dows not work.
				
				The database does not support foreign keys in tables not of
				type InnoDB. But I have changed it to these types and while
				creating the tables again, I run into an error message like this:
				
				
				Error
				
				SQL-query : 
				
				CREATE TABLE Formulare(
				id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,
				Name VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				EventName VARCHAR( 30 ) ,
				MenuHilfe VARCHAR( 100 ) ,
				AnwendungID INTEGER,
				Typ INTEGER NOT NULL ,
				PRIMARY KEY ( id ) ,
				FOREIGN KEY FK_AnwendungID( AnwendungID ) REFERENCES Anwendungen( id )
				) TYPE = INNODB
				
				MySQL said:
				
				Can't create table '.\lbdmf\formulare.frm' (errno: 150)
				
				
				Solutions:
				
				I would create the referencing logic at application level, but I haven't
				yet created a general class structure to hide this from normal application
				code.
				
				I still have a table that documents the foreign key column at a specific
				table. It hints to the primary table, wich would be a great help for me to
				only make minor changes in my code.
				
				
				
				TODO: Deactivate the part of reading out foreign keys by SQLForeignKeys.
				Directly use the table from lbdmf. Getting the primary key via SQLPrimaryKeys
				would be working.
				
				Table: ForeignKey_VisibleData_Mapping having these columns:

					(FKName, FKTable, PKName, PKTable)
				
				To handle the additional refferential from one table to primary table, I would still
				have a column PKName, but I store another field to hint to a column to show instead
				the primary key.
