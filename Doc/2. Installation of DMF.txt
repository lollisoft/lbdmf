Directory structure

The structure of this framework has a clear separation of interface files, include files, module files and
application module files. The base is a directory named develop. There is nothing outside this structure.
This is because the make system I use and relative path's.


A short overview of that structure at Installation time

The directory structure can be placed anywhere you have space. In the installation variant it will
be placed into C:\lbDMF. This is mostly an exsisting drive :-)

You have to change the settings, that will be appear as a description at a first run!

If you unzip the source distribution to C:\test and do subst Q: C:\Test, you can directly start the
described script at Q:\develop\Projects\CPP\watcomenv.bat twice

You can install it anywhere, but you should read below:


The following batch script describes how you will be informed at the first execution on that script:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if EXIST readme.txt goto WEITER:
set DEVLW=%%DEVLW%%
set DEVROOT=%%DEVROOT%%
echo ---------------------------------------------------------------- >> readme.txt
echo *                  Basic development settings                  * >> readme.txt
echo ---------------------------------------------------------------- >> readme.txt
echo * Please set the following two environment variables to your   * >> readme.txt
echo * actual unzipped source distribution.                         * >> readme.txt
echo * As example: If you have unzipped the distribution to C:\,    * >> readme.txt
echo * thn DEVLW is C: an DEVROOT will be %DEVLW%\dist\develop      * >> readme.txt
echo *                                                              * >> readme.txt

echo * DO NOT INSTALL it TO THE DEFAULT LOCATION LIKE:              * >> readme.txt 
echo *                                                              * >> readme.txt 
echo * C:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio                         * >> readme.txt
