/** \page FirstSample Beginning programming in DMF environment - Hello world.
 *
 * \section FirstSample1 Hello world sample code
 *
 * The sample is located in Samples/HelloWorld.
 *
 * \code
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	lbErrCodes err = ERR_NONE;
	lb_I_Module* mm = NULL;
	
	mm = getModuleInstance();
	mm->setModuleManager(mm, __FILE__, __LINE__);

	_CL_LOG << "Hello world" LOG_
	
	UAP_REQUEST(mm, lb_I_String, string)
	
	string->setData("Console logging...");
	_CL_LOG << string->charrep() LOG_

        return 0;
}
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section Details
 *	This is a very simple application. But it includes some special aspects, that a normal
 *	C++ application not have.
 *
 *	To use the string class lb_I_String (an interface to it), you must get an instance of the
 *	module manager. This class knows, where the implementations from an interface come from.
 *
 *	The function getModuleInstance(); located in lbHook, gets the DLL/so and function name
 *	information from environment variables. Then it creates an instance.
 *
 *	After creating the instance for the module manager, you see a _CL_LOG line. It outputs
 *	the given message to the console. This is similar to cout. In fakt, it is cout.
 *
 * \section UAP_REQUEST
 *	To get any instance for an interface, you need to request for that interface. UAP_REQUEST
 *	is a macro and hides some code. After that request, you will have an instance of a class
 *	having that interface.
 *
 *	You can see the usage of that class in the _CL_LOG line, followed after string->setData(...)
