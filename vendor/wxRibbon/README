Contained herein are the files created and/or modified by Peter Cawley (email
corsix@corsix.org) for the Google Summer of Code 2009 "wxWidgets Ribbon"
project (see http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/wx). Work
happened in the wxWidgets SOC2009_RIBBON SVN branch, which was branched from
trunk at r60293, and will probably be merged back into trunk in due course.

The bulk of the new files can be found in the following directories:
src/ribbon
include/wx/ribbon
interface/wx/ribbon
samples/ribbon

Files outside of these directories are more likely modified files rather than
new files.
