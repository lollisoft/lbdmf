    @class wxRibbonPanel

    Serves as a container for a group of (ribbon) controls. A wxRibbonPage will
    typically have panels for children, with the controls for that page placed
    on the panels.
    
    A panel adds a border and label to a group of controls, and can be
    minimised (either automatically to conserve space, or manually by the user).
    
    @sa wxRibbonPage
    
    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_DEFAULT_STYLE}
        Defined as no other flags set.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_NO_AUTO_MINIMISE}
        Prevents the panel from automatically minimising to conserve screen
        space.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_EXT_BUTTON}
        Causes an extension button to be shown in the panel's chrome (if the
        bar in which it is contained has wxRIBBON_BAR_SHOW_PANEL_EXT_BUTTONS
        set). The behaviour of this button is application controlled, but
        typically will show an extended drop-down menu relating to the
        panel.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_MINIMISE_BUTTON}
        Causes a (de)minimise button to be shown in the panel's chrome (if
        the bar in which it is contained has the
        wxRIBBON_BAR_SHOW_PANEL_MINIMISE_BUTTONS style set). This flag is
        typically combined with wxRIBBON_PANEL_NO_AUTO_MINIMISE to make a
        panel which the user always has manual control over when it
        minimises.
