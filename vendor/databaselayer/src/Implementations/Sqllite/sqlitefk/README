This is a simple tool that parses a basic dialect of SQL
looking for foreign key references, it then generates
SQL triggers to enforce them, it does not generate triggers
for cascading deletes at this time.

I've included a static x86 linux binary, and a win32 exe

usage:
    cat test.sql | ./fk > fktriggers.sql

usage win32:
    cat test.sql | fk.exe > fktriggers.sql

Any questions or suggestions to Cody Pisto <cpisto@gmail.com>
