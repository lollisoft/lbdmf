J.P. Redlich, the author of the book "CORBA 2.0 - Praktische
Einfuehrung fuer C++ und Java", has ported various programs from his
book to MICO. These files are located in the diretory demo/redlich of
the MICO source distribution. The author has placed his demo programs
under the GNU copyright. For this reason we were able to include the
complete sources of these programs with this distribution. Refer to
J.P. Redlich's book for explanations of the demos. In order to compile
them, you simply need to run "make" from this directory.
